Data
science
is
an
interdisciplinary
field
focused
on
extracting
knowledge
from
data
sets
which
are
typically
large
see
big

applying
the

The
field
encompasses
preparing
data
for
analysis
formulating
data
science
problems
analyzing
data
developing
data

identified

Relationship
to
statistics
Many
statisticians
including
Nate
Silver
have
argued
that
data
science
is
not
new
field
but
rather
another
name
for
statistics
12
Others
argue
that
data
science
is
distinct
from
statistics
because
it
focuses
on
problems
and
techniques
unique
to
digital
data
13
Vasant
Dhar
writes
that
statistics
emphasizes
quantitative
data
and
description
In
contrast
data
science
deals
with
quantitative
and
qualitative
data
images
and
emphasizes
prediction
and
action
14
Andrew
Gelman
of
Columbia
University
has
described
statistics
as
nonessential
part
of
data
science
15
Stanford
professor
David
Donoho
writes
that
data
science
is
not
distinguished
from
statistics
by
the
size
of
datasets
or
use
of
computing
and
that
many
graduate
programs
misleadingly
advertise
their
analytics
and
statistics
training
as
the
essence
of
data
science
program
He
describes
data
science
as
an
applied
field
growing
out
of
traditional
statistics
16
In
summary
data
science
can
be
therefore
described
as
an
applied
branch
of
statistics
Etymology
Early
usage
In
1962,
John
Tukey
described
field
he
called
data
analysis
which
resembles
modern
data
science
16
In
1985,
in
lecture
given
to
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
in
Beijing
Jeff
Wu
used
the
term
Data
Science
for
the
first
time
as
an
alternative
name
for
statistics
17
Later
attendees
at
1992
statistics
symposium
at
the
University
of
Montpellier
II
acknowledged
the
emergence
of
new
discipline
focused
on
data
of
various
origins
and
forms
combining
established
concepts
and
principles
of
statistics
and
data
analysis
with
computing
18
19
The
term
data
science
has
been
traced
back
to
1974,
when
Peter
Naur
proposed
it
as
an
alternative
name
for
computer
science
20
In
1996,
the
International
Federation
of
Classification
Societies
became
the
first
conference
to
specifically
feature
data
science
as
topic
20
However
the
definition
was
still
in
flux
After
the
1985
lecture
in
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
in
Beijing
in
1997
Jeff
Wu
again
suggested
that
statistics
should
be
renamed
data
science
He
reasoned
that
new
name
would
help
statistics
shed
inaccurate
stereotypes
such
as
being
synonymous
with
accounting
or
limited
to
describing
data
21
In
1998,
Hayashi
Chikio
argued
for
data
science
as
new
interdisciplinary
concept
with
three
aspects
data
design
collection
and
analysis
19
During
the
1990
popular
terms
for
the
process
of
finding
patterns
in
datasets
which
were
increasingly
large
included
knowledge
discovery
and
data
mining
22
20
Modern
usage
The
modern
conception
of
data
science
as
an
independent
discipline
is
sometimes
attributed
to
William
Cleveland
23
In
2001
paper
he
advocated
an
expansion
of
statistics
beyond
theory
into
technical
areas
because
this
would
significantly
change
the
field
it
warranted
new
name
22
Data
science
became
more
widely
used
in
the
next
few
years
in
2002,
the
Committee
on
Data
for
Science
and
Technology
launched
Data
Science
Journal
In
2003,
Columbia
University
launched
The
Journal
of
Data
Science
22
In
2014,
the
American
Statistical
Association's
Section
on
Statistical
Learning
and
Data
Mining
changed
its
name
to
the
Section
on
Statistical
Learning
and
Data
Science
reflecting
the
ascendant
popularity
of
data
science
24
The
professional
title
of
data
scientist
has
been
attributed
to
DJ
Patil
and
Jeff
Hammerbacher
in
2008
25
Though
it
was
used
by
the
National
Science
Board
in
their
2005
report
Long
Lived
Digital
Data
Collections
Enabling
Research
and
Education
in
the
21
st
Century
it
referred
broadly
to
any
key
role
in
managing
digital
data
collection
26
There
is
still
no
consensus
on
the
definition
of
data
science
and
it
is
considered
by
some
to
be
buzzword
27
Impact
Big
data
is
very
quickly
becoming
vital
tool
for
businesses
and
companies
of
all
sizes
28
The
availability
and
interpretation
of
big
data
has
altered
the
business
models
of
old
industries
and
enabled
the
creation
of
new
ones

Data
scientists
are
responsible
for
breaking
down
big
data
into
usable
information
and
creating
software
and
algorithms
that
help
companies
and
organizations
determine
optimal
operations
29
As
big
data
continues
to
have
major
impact
on
the
world
data
science
does
as
well
due
to
the
close
relationship
between
the
two
29
Technologies
and

are
